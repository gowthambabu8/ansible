ONS....

1. No idempotent
2. No error handling
3. little complex
4. large scale servers handling is tough
5. distribution specific, homogenous.

scp mongodb.repo mongodb.sh ec2-user@<private-ip>/tmp/git-repo - copy files from 1 server to another server.
ssh ec2-user@<private-ip> 'touch sample_file.txt' - creates sample file in another server.

configuration management:
-------------------------
provisioning server -> baseline it according to our needs.

1. installing programming languages.
2. creating system users and folders.
3. installing some packages.
4. downloading source code.
5. installing dependencies.
6. creating systemctl service.
7. enable and starting the services.

CRUD of configuration.
* 2 types of modes.
	PUSH - to ruunning servers from CM server.
		1. using ssh protocol they will send updates.
		2. no agent software.
	PULL - from CM server. we need agent server in each node.
		1. unneccessary installation
		2. resources wastage.
		3. unneccessary traffic
		4. no adhoc updates.
		5. new protocol to connet to CM server.
* before we have chef, puppet but because of push model by ansible it became popular.
* Ansible is developed in Python. it is command line tool.
* protocol, port, username, password.IP
* dnf install ansible -y
* ansible all -i <ip_address>, -e ansible_user=ec2-user -e ansible_password=DevOps321 -m ping
* ansible all -i <ip_address>, -e ansible_user=ec2-user -e ansible_password=DevOps321 -m dnf -a "name=nginx state=installed" -> run as normal user
* ansible all -i <ip_address>, -e ansible_user=ec2-user -e ansible_password=DevOps321 -b -m dnf -a "name=nginx state=installed" -> run as super user
* ansible all -i <ip_address>, -e ansible_user=ec2-user -e ansible_password=DevOps321 -b -m service -a "name=nginx state=started" 
* linux commands - ansible modules, collections.
* green - success but no change
* yellow - changed - state also changed
* red- error - no change to state
* All the commands we will keep in playbook. It uses yaml structure.
* DTO - data transfer objects
